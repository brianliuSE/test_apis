Each character in the Trace ID string shall take a value of \"0\" to \"9\", \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent 4 bits. The most significant character representing the 4 most significant bits of the Trace ID shall appear first in the string, and the character representing the 4 least significant bit of the Trace ID shall appear last in the string.

Each character in the string shall take a value of \"0\" to \"9\", \"a\" to \"f\" or \"A\" to \"F\" and shall represent 4 bits. The most significant character representing the 4 most significant bits shall appear first in the string, and the character representing the 4 least significant bit shall appear last in the string. Octets shall be coded according to 3GPP TS 32.422.
